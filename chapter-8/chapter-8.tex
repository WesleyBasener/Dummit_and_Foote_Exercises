	\begin{problem}{1.3}
		Let $R$ be a Euclidean Domain. Let $\mathit{m}$ be the minimum integer in the set of norms of nonzero elements of $R$. Prove that every nonzero element of $R$ of norm $\mathit{m}$ is a unit. Deduce that a nonzero element of norm zero (if such an element exists) is a unit.
		\begin{proof}
			Let $x$ be the element of R with minimal norm $\mathit{m}$. By definition of a Euclidean Domain, there must be some elements $q, r$ in $R$ such that $1 = qx + r$, where $N(r)<N(x)$ or $r=0$ and $1$ is unity. Since $x$ has minimal norm, $r=0$. Hence, $1=qx$ and x is a unit. Since the minimal possible norm is always $0$, any nonzero element of norm $0$ will hence be a unit.
			\end{proof}
	\end{problem}
	
	\begin{problem}{1.4}
		Let R be a Euclidean Domain.\\
		\begin{itemize}
			
		
			\item[(a)] Prove that if $(a,b)=1$ and $a$ divides $bc$, then $a$ divides $c$. More generally, prove that if $a$ divides $bc$ with nonzero $a,b$ then $\frac{a}{(a,b)}$ divides $c$.
			\item[(b)] Consider the Diophantine equation $ax+by=N$ where $a,b$ and $N$ are integers and $a,b$ are nonzero. Suppose $x_{0}, y_{0}$ is a solution: $ax_{0}+by_{0}=N$. Prove that the full set of solutions to this equation is given by
			$x=x_{0} + m \frac{b}{(a,b)}$, $y=y_{0} - m \frac{a}{(a,b)}$
			as $m$ ranges over the integers. [If $x,y$ is a solution to $ax+by=N$, show that $a(x-x_{0}) = b(y_{0} - y)$ and use (a).]
		\end{itemize}
	
	
		\begin{proof}
			For part a, since $a|bc$, we must have some $q \in R$ such that $qa = bc$. By theorem 4, we have that $xa + yb = 1$ for some $x,y \in R$. Multiplying both sides by $c$, we get $xac + ybc = xac + yqa = c$. Factoring $a$ from the left, we can see that $a$ divides $c$ $a(xc + yq)=c$.
			\\
			For part b, if $x, y$ are any solution, then $xa + yb = N = x_{0}a + y_{0}b$. Which can be factored as $a(x-x_{0}) = b(y_{0} - y)$. By part a, $\frac{a}{((a,b))} | (y_{0} - y)$, meaning there is some $m$ such that $m\frac{a}{((a,b))} = y_{0} - y$ which of course means $y = y_{0} - m \frac{a}{(a,b)}$. Substituting for $y$, we find $a(x-x_{0}) = b(y_{0} - y_{0} + m\frac{a}{(a,b)}) = \frac{mba}{(a,b)}$ Solving for $x$, we have $x = x_{0} + m \frac{b}{(a,b)}$. Therefore, every solution to the Diophantine equation is of the form $x=x_{0} + m \frac{b}{(a,b)}$, $y=y_{0} - m \frac{a}{(a,b)}$.
		\end{proof}
	\end{problem}
	
	\begin{problem}{2.1}
		Prove that in a Principle Ideal Domain two ideals $(a)$ and $(b)$ are comaximal if and only if a greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is $1$.
		\begin{proof}
			 Since we are in a PID, there must be some $e$ in $R$ such that $(e) = (a) + (b)$. Suppose $d$ be the gcd of $a$ and $b$. Any element of $(a) + (b)$ is also in $(d)$ meaning $d$ generates $(a) + (b)$. Since $d$ is the gcd of $a$ and $b$, it follows that $(d)$ is the smallest ideal containing $(a) + (b)$. $(d)$ cannot be larger than $(e)$ for this reason. $(d)$ also cannot be smaller than $(e)$, otherwise $(e)$ would contain elements outside of $(a) + (b)$. Therefore, $(d) = (e)$. It is now obvious that $(a) + (b) = R$ if and only if $(d) = 1$. 
		\end{proof}
	\end{problem}
	
	\begin{problem}{2.2}
		Prove than any two nonzero elements of a PID have a least common multiple.
		\begin{proof}
			For any $a$ and $b$ in R, having an lcm is equivalent to there being a single element $L$ generating the largest possible ideal contained in both $(a)$ and $(b)$. The intersection of $(a)$ and $(b)$ is the largest possible ideal contained in both $(a)$ and $(b)$. This intersection must have a single generator $(L)$. Therefore, $L$ is the lcm of $a$ and $b$. 
		\end{proof}
	\end{problem}
	
	\begin{problem}{2.3}
		Prove that the quotient of a PID by a prime ideal is again a PID.
		\begin{proof}
			Let $R$ be the PID and $P$ be a prime ideal in $R$. Let $I$ be an ideal in $R/P$ then $I' = \{r : r + P \in I\}$ is an ideal in $R$. $I'$ must have a single generator $i$, in $R$. Therefore, $I = (i) + P$ and $I$ is a principle ideal. 
		\end{proof}
	\end{problem}
	
	\begin{problem}{2.4}
		
		Let $R$ be an integral domain. Prove that if the following two conditions hold, then $R$ is a PID.
		(i) any two nonzero elements $a$ and $b$ of $R$ have a greatest common divisor which can be written in the form $ra+sb$ for some $r,s \in R$, and (ii) if $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, ...$ are nonzero elements of $R$ such that $a_{i+2}|a_{i}$ for all $i$, then there is a positive integer $N$ such that $a_{n}$ is a unit for all $n \geq N$.
		\begin{proof}
			Let $I$ be any ideal in $R$. Let $a_{1}$ be any element of $I$. If $a_{1}$ generates $I$, then $I$ is principle. Otherwise, there must be some $b_{1}$ in $I$, which does not divide $a_{1}$. Let $a_{2}$ be the gcd of $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$. If $a_{2}$ generates $I$, then $I$ is, again, principle. Otherwise, we continue the process to find a sequence of elements $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, ... $. If this sequence terminates with a generator, $I$ is ideal. Otherwise, since we have $a_{i+2}|a_{i}$ for all $i$, there must be some $N$ such that $a_{n \geq N}$ are all units. This would mean that $(1)$ is a generator of $I$ and $I$ is principle. Therefore, must be $I$ principle.
		\end{proof}
	\end{problem}
	
	\begin{problem}{2.5}
		Let $R$ be the quadratic integer ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt[]{-5}]$. Define the ideals $I_{2}=(2,1+\sqrt[]{-5})$, $I_{3}=(3,2+\sqrt[]{-5})$, and $I_{3}'=(3,2-\sqrt[]{-5})$.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[(a)] Prove that $I_{2}$, $I_{3}$ and $I_{3}'$ are nonprinciple ideals in R.
			\item[(b)] Prove that the product of two nonprinciple ideals can be principle by showing that $I_{2}^{2} = (2)$.
			\item[(c)] Prove similarly that $I_{2}I_{3}=(1-\sqrt[]{-5})$ and $I_{2}I_{3}'=(1+\sqrt[]{-5})$ are principle. Conclude that the principle ideal $(6)$ is the product of four ideals $I_{2}^{2}I_{3}I_{3}'$.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{proof}
			For (a), the ideals all have relatively prime generators. So, their single element generator would need to be $1$. But $1$ itself is not contained in any of the ideals. Therefore, none of them are principle.\\
			For (b) The generators for $I_{1}^{2}$ are $4$, $2+2\sqrt[]{-5}$, and $4-2\sqrt[]{-5}$. These give the term $2(2+2\sqrt[]{-5}) + (4-4\sqrt[]{-5}) = 2$. So $2$ is in $I_{2}^{2}$. Since $2$ can generate all the generators, $(2)=I_{2}^{2}$.\\
			For c, ...
		\end{proof}
	\end{problem}
	
	\begin{problem}{2.6}
		Let $R$ be an integral domain and suppose that every prime ideal in R is principle. This exercise proves that every ideal of $R$ is principle i.e. $R$ is a PID.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[(a)] Assume that the set of ideals of $R$ that are not principle is nonempty and prove that this set has a maximal element under inclusion (which by hypothesis is not prime). [Use Zorn's Lemma.]
			\item[(b)] Let $I$ be an ideal which is maximal with respect to being nonprinciple, and let $a,b \in R$ with $ab \in I$ but $a \notin I$ and $b \notin I$. Let $I_{a} = (I, a)$ be the ideal generated by $I$ and $a$, let $I_{b}=(I, b)$ be the ideal generated by $I$ and $b$, and define $J=\{ r \in R | r I_{a} \subseteq I\}$. Prove that $I_{a}=(\alpha)$ and $J=(\beta)$ are principle ideals in $R$ with $I \subseteqq I_{b} \subseteq J$ and $I_{a}J = (\alpha \beta) \subseteq I$.
			\item[(c)] If $x \in I$ show that $x=s\alpha$ for some $s \in J$. Deduce that $I = I_{a}J$ is principle, a contradiction, and conclude that $R$ is a PID.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{proof}
			Let $\Sigma$ be the set of all ideals in $R$ that are not principle, and assume for the sake of contradiction that it is nonempty. We can define a binary relation on $\Sigma$ where for any elements $I_{a}, I_{b}$ in $\Sigma$, $I_{a} \leq I_{b}$ if $I_{a} \subseteq I_{b}$. It is clear that this relation is reflexive, anti-symmetric, and transitive. It is therefore a partial order. For any possibly infinite chain $I_{0}, I_{1}, ...$ in $\Sigma$, the union of every element in the chain $ \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty} I_{n}$ is also an ideal. This can be seen by letting $x$ be any element of this union and letting $r$ be any element of $R$. $rx$ is an element of every ideal that $x$ is in, thus it is also an element of $ \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty} I_{n}$. Note also that if $x$ generates the union, then $x$ generates whatever ideal(s) it is in, which contradicts the ideals being nonprinciple. So, there is no $x$ which generates the union and the union is therefore in $\Sigma$. By our partial order, the union is the upper bound of the chain and is in $\Sigma$. By Zorn's lemma, $\Sigma$ has a maximal element on inclusion.\\
			\\
			Since $I $ is a subset of $I_{a}$ and $I$ is the maximal nonprinciple ideal, $I_{a}$ must be principle and is hence generated by some $\alpha$ (Note to self, never write a question where $a$ and $\alpha$ represent different variables)\\
			Any element $i$ of $I$, is in both $I$ and $R$. So, $i^{2}$ is in $rI$. Hence, $i$ is in $J$. Since $J$ contains $I$, $J$ must be principle as well. So, $J$ is also generated by a single element $\beta$.\\
			$I$ is obviously a subset of $I_{b}$, with $b \notin I$. So, $I$ is a proper subset of $I_{b}$.\\
			$ba$ is in $I$ with $b \in R$ and $a \in I_{a}$. So, $b$ is in $J$. Since $I$ is also in $J$, $I_{b}$ is a subset of $J$.\\
			Since $J$ is by definition the set of elements that when multiplied by $I_{a}$ is in $I$, $I_{a}J$ is a subset of $I$.\\
			\\
			Let $x$ be in $I$, then $x$ is in $I_{a}$, and $x = s\alpha$ for some $s$ in $R$. Since $s\alpha$ is in $I$, then $sr\alpha = sI_{a}$ is in $I$ for all $r$ in $R$. Thus, $s$ is in $J$. So, $I=I_{a}J$ is principle, which contradicts our hypothesis and. Therefore, the set of nonprinciple ideal in $R$ is empty.
		\end{proof}

		\begin{problem}{2.7}
			An integral domain where every ideal generated by two elements is principle is called a Bezout domain.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[(a)]prove that the integral domain $R$ is a Bezout domain if and only if every pair of elements $a$, $b$ of $R$ has a gcd $d$ in $R$ that can be written as an $R$-linear combination of $a$ and $b$ (ie. $d=xa+yb$ for some $x$ and $y$ in $R$).
				\item[(b)]Prove that every finitely generated ideal of a Bezout domain is principle.
				\item[(c)] Let $F$ be the fraction field of the Bezout domain $R$. Prove that every element of $F$ can be written in the form $a/b$ where $a,b \in R$ and $a$ and $b$ relatively prime.
			\end{itemize}
			
			\begin{proof}
				For part a, $R$ is Bezout if and only if for any $a$ and $b$ in $R$, there exists a $d$ in $R$ such that $(a,b)=(d)$. This implies that $d$ divides both $a$ and $b$. If there is another element $c$ of $R$, which divides $a$ and $b$, then $(c)$ is a subset of $(a,b)$ and is hence a subset of $(d)$ meaning $cx=d$ for some $x$ in $R$. So $d$ is the gcd of $a$ and $b$. Since $(d)=(a,b)$, it is obvious that there is some $x$ and $y$ in $R$ such that $ax+by=d$.\\
				\\
				For part b, let $I$ be finitely generated. Then $I = (a_{1}, a_{2}, ... ,a_{n})$. We can rewrite this as $(a_{1}, a_{2}) \cup (a_{3}, ... , a_{n}) = (a_{1,2}) \cup (a_{3}, ... , a_{n}) = (a_{1,2}, a_{3}, ... , a_{n})$. By induction, we can continue rewriting the ideal until we have $I=(a_{1,2,...,n})$\\
				\\
				For part c, let $a$ and $b$ be in $R$. From part a, we know $a$ and $b$ have a gcd, $d$. Now, let $a = a'd$ and $b=b'd$. Then, $a/b$ can be written as $a'/b'$. If $d$ is one, then $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, and there is no need to factor the fraction.
